# Overview

The view takes data from the model and presents it to the user. Views emit events for various user actions. The view itself does not process these actions or update the model.

# App views

See [app/README.md](app/README.md) for information on the app view subsystem.

# Popups

See [popups/README.md](popups/README.md) for information on the popup view subsystem.
