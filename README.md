# Cubezapp

**CURRENT STATUS**: Right now, this is a *rough draft*. The code is terrible. Please don't even use this. It's just for a select group of testers. I emphasize again: if you are looking at this to evaluate how good at programming I am, please stop. Just go away. Close your eyes. Thanks, bye.

Cubezapp will be the best cube timer in existence. It will support scramble generation and 3D rendering (with WebGL), online cloud storage for times, graphs, statistic analysis, and more.

# TODO

 * Make model requests cancellable
 * Create color "themes"
 * Implement multiple selection in times list
 * Implement stats on selected region of solves
 * Compute stats in background WebWorker
 * Re-code puzzle deletion
 * Implement *real* puzzle creation flow
